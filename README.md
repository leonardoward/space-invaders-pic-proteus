# space-invaders-pic-proteus
PG-7233 C for Embedded Systems - Project 

This project is a cover of the classic videogame Space Invaders, developed for a PIC microcontroller using [MPLABX](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide) and simulated on [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/simulation/)

This project contains the firmware and simulation of videogame . 

The microprocessor used was the PIC24FJ128GA010 to manage all the digital signals. This repository includes a [MPLABX](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide) project, with the source code for the microcontroller (the folder Hela.X). It also contains a [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/simulation/) project  used to simulate and test the electronic design.

The design is a modular system that allows the user to multiple usage modes for an [110V/220V LED Strip](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005001989354694.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.15731814f4HM3v&algo_pvid=82597dfd-2696-4544-87ad-ca4784616c1c&algo_expid=82597dfd-2696-): they can be turn on/of manually or automatically depending on a the time of the day or the amount of light in the environment.

For further information about the design requirements and the overall design visit the [Documents](https://github.com/leonardoward/Sensor-Based-Ambient-Lights/tree/main/Documents) folder for a more detailed report.

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

The project only requires the following development environments:

* [MPLABX](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide)
* [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/simulation/)

The Proteus project uses components the are contained in the environment by default, doesn't require additional component imports.
